   LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE-  THOSE DATA ELEMENTS WHICH ARE ARRANGED SEQUENTIALLY OR LINEARLY  I.E WHERE EACH ELEMENT IS ATTACHED TO ITS PREVIOUSLY AND NEXT ADJACENT ELEMENTS.
   IS CALLED LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE.EG-  STACK, ARRAYS, QUEUES, LINKED LIST ETC
   
   NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE-  THE DATA ITEMS ARE NOT IN SEQUENCE EX-TREES, GRPAPHS.
   
   >STATIC DATA STRUCTUE- THESE ARE ONE WHOSE SIZES AND STRUCTURES, ASSOCIATED MEMORY LOCATION ARE FIXED AT COMPILE TIME.
   
   DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURE- THESE ARE ONES WHICH EXPAND OR SHRINK AS REQUIRED DURING THE PROGRAM EXECUTION AND THERE ASSOCIATE
